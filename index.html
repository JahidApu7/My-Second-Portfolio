          <p>Do you like panning for gold? This last winter, a team of eight rugged mountain men trekked through howling winds and blinding snow into the most remote area of Alaska. The goal: to hopefully find some gold. After two months of crushing disappointment, this group of prospectors stumbled upon the biggest find of their lives! Three weeks later, the team emerged to tell their story. In this article, I'll tell you all about it.
  
              Which story do you want to read?
              
              The first one is boring, and you know the secret - they found a 4-pound gold nugget. In the second example, there is drama and mystery. It makes you read the rest at least to find out what they found.</b></p>

      <p>Those of you who watch my YouTube channel will already be familiar with this amazing skirt. I was singing its praises for managing to be that micro length I love, while keeping your dignity safe with a little hidden nylon shorts that lurk underneath. With the check print and wool fabric, despite flashing your legs to the world, this really does feel like a very transitional-appropriate piece.</b></p>
